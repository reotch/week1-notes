                <h2>Tuesday, 16 April 2019</h2>
                    <p>Light on notes today. We started by whiteboarding our pre-work Python problems. Each problem had a randomly selected person attached to it, and those primary problem solvers were given help by the others.</p>
                    <p>Lucas was assigned to question 5, which dealt with creating a function that would determine whether numbers in a list were consecutive and return True or False. I had problems with determining how to move from one index to another.</p>
                    <p>The solution makes sense.</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <blockquote><pre># This is the solution Lucas came up with to iterate through the list
                            def is_consecutive(a_list): # define the function "is_consecutive"
                                a_list.sort() # sort the list; this is my addition
                                for i in range(1, len(a_list)): # for "i" ("index item") in the range from index 1 to the length of a_list
                                    if a_list[i] - 1 != a_list[i - 1]: 
                                    """if the index of "i", which starts at index 1, minus the integer 1 is not equal to a_list index of i - 1 index number"""
                                        return(False)
                                return(True) # put outside the for loop so that if nothing returns false
                            
                            print(is_consecutive([24, 22, 23]))</pre></blockquote>

                    <p>We also got an introduction to Brijesh and Dion, who were unable to attend the first day. They demoed their HTML projects, and we discussed the idea that <strong>modern industry practice is to start developing a site for mobile first, then work on larger screens later</strong>. I'm not doing that for this site, so shame on me.</p>
                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                        <p>It is best to start working on an HTML page by first sketching it out &ndash; on a whiteboard, piece of paper, bar napkin, whathaveyou.</p>
                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                        <p>CSS is read by importance. An inline style is the most important. Then an internal CSS, then an external CSS.</p>       
                        <p>An external CSS document is standard and the best practice. In a stylesheet the order of precedence is <em>element, ID, class</em>.</p>
                        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_boxmodel.asp" target="_blank">Box Model</a> highlights how blocks are treated by CSS selectors.</p>
